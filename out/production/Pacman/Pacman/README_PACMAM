README - PACMAN
===============

OVERVIEW:
===========
- This program is a version of the popular game PACMAN. As soon as the program begins, pacman across the maze by the
help of key input, and the Ghost are hunting pacman using BFS (the blue space represents the wall into which pacman
nor ghosts can't go through).

- When pacman collide with the big dot (energizer), the dot disappear from the board and the score increase by 10;
when it collides with an energizer, the energizer disappear from the board and the score increase by 20, and all the
ghosts turn FRIGHTENED mode; when pacman collides with a ghost, (all the ghosts and pacman return to their initial
location and pacman life reduces by one when the collided ghost was in a mode other than FRIGHTENED;
 otherwise, the collided ghost will return to the pen and the score will increase by 100.

 - The Ghosts are changing their modes on various amount of time

- The game also  have a quit button for quit, and labels on the bottom of the pane to display the update of the game
at every  moment

- Once the lives reaches 0, the label of Game over come and the game stops.

DESIGN CHOICES:
================
- I created a WRAPPER class of the Square & Ghost with encapsulates all the functionalities and capabilities of
a square & a Ghost
- I also made use of Inheritance. I have my Dot class, which is the superclass for Energizer and Pacman, which prevent
me from defining similar methods so many times at once
- I also used association between different classes
- Lastly, I used interface of Collidable which is implemented by dots, Energizer, and Ghost

KNOWN BUGS:

SRC:
=====
- I choose the black background color for the board to be BLACK, because it makes it easier to visualize on the board
and the color diversity of the pieces makes the game more appealing, and friendly to people who are color blind
